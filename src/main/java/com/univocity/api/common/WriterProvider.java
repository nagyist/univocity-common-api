	 * Considering the entity is configured to write its headers to the output, the <code>isEmpty()</code> method will be queried and:

	 * If {@link #clearDestination()} was invoked in the same transaction, uniVocity will know the entity is empty and will then attempt to write the header row.
	 * However, as it cannot determine whether the output has data already written in it; Mappings where {@link #clearDestination()} is not used
	 * might produce outputs without the header row. This is likely to occur in write-only entities with no initial data.
